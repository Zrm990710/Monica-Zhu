## Titanic survivor prediction project: 
### Using Pandas to import and read data, use the info function to find which columns have missing values; Use Describe function to understand the dataset better; 
### Define a Pipeline named num_ Pipeline, fill in missing values by using the median; Define another pipeline called cat_ Pipeline, using MostFrequentImputer to fill in missing values; After filling in the missing values, combine the two pipeline to a complete preprocess_pipeline and get the training data; 
### Use three different machine learning models: LinearRegression Decision, TreeRegressor, and RandomForestRegression for cross-validation
