## Titanic survivor prediction project: 
### Using Pandas to import and read data, use the info function to find which columns have missing values; Use Describe function to understand the dataset better; 
### Define a Pipeline named num_ Pipeline, fill in missing values using the median for the Age, SibSp, Parch, and Fare columns; Define a pipeline called num_pipeline, using the median to fill in missing values for columns Pclass, Sex, and Embarked; Define another pipeline called cat_ Pipeline, using MostFrequentImputer to fill in missing values for columns Pclass, Sex, and Embarked; After filling in the missing values, combine the two pipeline to a complete preprocess_pipeline and get the training data; 
### Use three different machine learning models: LinearRegression Decision, TreeRegressor, and RandomForestRegression for cross-validation
